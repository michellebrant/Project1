# Inside Out: Save Riley's Memories!
## Inside Out : Save Riley's Memories Game

In this web browser game based on Pixar's hit film Inside Out (2015), Riley's memories are in danger of being lost forever in the Memory Dump. Help Riley save her memories or risk loosing her personality islands forever. Once the game begins, Riley's memories will fall from the top of the screen. In order to save the memories users must click on the orb (purple orbs require one click, gold orbs require double click). Purple orbs are worth 10 points, gold orbs are worth 20 poitns. If a user misses a purple orb they are docked 20 points, and if they miss a gold orb they automatically loose. If the score falls below 0 the user looses. 

## Process 

As a player in the game, I wanted the user to play in order to interact with the memories, track their points, and ultimately win/loose. I began with setting out a wireframe from the game, pictured below:
